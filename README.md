# Air India Flight & Lost Luggage Management Project

This project simulates Air Indiaâ€™s flight operations and lost luggage management using MySQL and Power BI. It demonstrates relational data analysis, SQL querying, data visualization, and the creation of dashboard reports to help monitor flight performance, baggage resolution, and investigation team efficiency.

---

## Project Objectives

- Analyze flight status: on-time, delayed, or cancelled.
- Track and resolve lost luggage cases using resolution logs.
- Evaluate the performance of investigation teams.
- Create an interactive dashboard to visualize flight and baggage data.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- MySQL 8.0 (Relational database)
- Power BI Desktop (Dashboard and visualizations)
- SQL (Data querying and views)
- ODBC Connector
- DAX (Custom measures in Power BI)
- CSV (Raw data source)

---

---

## How to Use

1. Import the CSV files from the Data/ folder into your MySQL database.
2. Run queries.sql to generate insights and explore flight/luggage data.
3. Run views.sql to create reusable views for reporting.
4. Open dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop and connect it to your MySQL instance.
5. Refresh the visuals and interact with the dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard provides:
- A summary of flight counts and status distribution.
- A breakdown of delayed and cancelled flights.
- Resolution timelines and current status of lost luggage reports.
- Investigation team involvement and performance tracking.

---

## Notes

- CSV files were imported directly into MySQL without primary or foreign keys.
- EER diagram generation was skipped due to the absence of relational constraints.
- Data used in the project is simulated for educational purposes.
